Welcome to my digital domain!

I'm building this site as a blog and portfolio site. I intend to share
recipes, talk about software, share and discuss my projects, my views,
and my experiences.

A bit about my identities (in no particular order):
  * Trans (agender AMAB), pronouns: they/them
  * Bisexual
  * Autistic
  * Parent
  * Disabled
  * Gamer
  * Geek

Professionally, I am a software architect with a background in
infrastructure. You can find my resume at my
[old site](https://plathrop.tertiusfamily.net "Link to Resume") for now,
though I intend to move that content here eventually.

A few of my interests:
  * Advocacy
  * Punching Nazis
  * Gaming
  * Programming
  * Tabletop Roleplaying Games
  * AuDHD fixation of the week (currently gemcutting)
