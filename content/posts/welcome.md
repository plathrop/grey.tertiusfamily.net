Welcome to my digital domain!

I'm building this site as a blog and portfolio site. I intend to share
recipes, talk about software, share and discuss my projects, my views,
and my experiences.

A bit about my identities (in no particular order):
  * <img src="/images/flags/Transgender_Pride_flag.svg" width=20 style="border: 1px solid;" /> Trans
    * <img src="/images/flags/Nonbinary_flag.svg" width=20 style="border: 1px solid;" /> Agender
    * my pronouns are they/them
  * <img src="/images/flags/Bisexual_Pride_flag.svg" width=20 style="border: 1px solid;" /> Bisexual
  * <img src="/images/flags/Furry_Pride_flag.png" width=20 style="border: 1px solid;" /> Furry
    * (probably doesn't mean what you think)
  * Autistic
  * Parent
  * Disabled

Professionally, I am a software architect with a background in
infrastructure. You can find my resume at my
[old site](https://plathrop.tertiusfamily.net "Link to Resume") for now,
though I intend to move that content here eventually.

A few of my interests:
  * Advocacy
  * Punching Nazis
  * Gaming
  * Programming
  * Tabletop Roleplaying Games
  * AuDHD fixation of the week (currently gemcutting)
